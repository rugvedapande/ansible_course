# Create a YAML file that contains a dictionary representing a networking
# device (in an expanded YAML format). The highest level key should be the
# device name (for example, "rtr1"). The value corresponding to that key
# should be another dictionary. This inner dictionary should have the
# following key-value pairs (host, username, password, device_type, use_session_log).
# use_session_log should be a YAML-boolean, the rest of the values should be strings.
# Use the "print_yaml.py" python script to print the contents of the YAmL file to stdout.
