# Create a YAML file that is a nested data structure. The highest level data
# structure should be a dictionary with a key-name of "network_devices".
# The value corresponding to this key should be a two-element list. Each element
# of this list should contain a dictionary with six key-value pairs
# (host, username, password, device_type, use_session_log, ip_addresses).
# The ip_addresses key should point to a list of IP addresses that each network
# device contains (just make up three IP addresses for each device).
